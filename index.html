Dear friends,I'm sorry, this is my first time to ask for help online. I'm really desperate. Maybe this help is my last hope to live. I don't know how long I can bear it.

Illness does not take away life, but it consumes a lot of money. I'm in debt for $30000 now. I feel like I can't afford it. Because I live in a poor city, I have a low income here. These debt pressures make me unable to face.

I don't know if this message can get help. Jesus bless us.

If you can help me, please send the amount of your sponsorship funds and your personal wallet address to my email. If I can pull through, I'll give it back. Jesus bless you.

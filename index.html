<p>Dear friends,I'm sorry, this is my first time to ask for help online. I'm really desperate. Maybe this help is my last hope to live. I don't know how long I can bear it.</p>

<p>Illness does not take away life, but it consumes a lot of money. I'm in debt for $30000 now. I can't afford it. Because I live in a poor city, I have a low income here. These debt pressures make me unable to face.</p>
<p>I hope you will give me a little help, which is the last hope to support me to live.</p>
<p>I don't know if this message can get help. Jesus bless us.</p>

<p>If you can help me, please send the amount of your sponsorship funds and your personal wallet address to my email. If I can pull through, I will try my best to return it slowly in the future.  Jesus bless you.</p>
